# Learnzy-Learning-System

Welcome to Learnzy, an interactive learning platform designed to make learning fun and effective for children of preschool and school age. Our application offers a wide range of content from various areas, including the alphabet, spelling, math, animals, and more. With a user-friendly interface and engaging content, children can learn and improve their knowledge through various games and quizzes.

The Learnzy application is designed to be used with the help of an adult, with a simple interface that allows for easy navigation to desired activities. Parents can track their child's progress and identify areas for improvement, ensuring a personalized learning experience.

Our application is built using the latest technologies and tools, including Spring Framework in Java for the backend, React as an open-source JavaScript library for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for database management. We use Junit and Mockito for testing in Java, along with GitHub as a web-based version control platform and Jira for managing project tasks.

We're excited to offer a fun and engaging way for children to learn and grow their knowledge.
